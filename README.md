# Python-dataquest-prisonbreak-project
I created this project while doing my Dataquest python data analyst certificate

This is the first project in the certificate.
It tests the use of list manipulation, loops, extracting data from graphs and reorganising it to answer questions

Data was extraced from a wikipedia page listing all the prison escapes that used a helicopter as its method of escape.
I then manipulated it to find which year had the most prision breaks, which country had the most prision breaks and the names of the people that attemped an escape more than once.
